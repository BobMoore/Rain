Hello and Welcome to the Rain Project!

This project is designed to create a framework for automated testing. 

The Tool will create tags and items as you create them!

You will need to use a web hosting service in order to use this. Currently I am using Jetty 7, which is a free program 
to download. In order to deploy this program to Jetty, you simply need ant in the mywebapp folder, and then copy the war
folder and place it into the webapps folder in the Jetty home directory.
